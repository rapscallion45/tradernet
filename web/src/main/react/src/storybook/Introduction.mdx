# Tradernet - Component Library

## About

This is the component library for the Tradernet web application. It is built using React and Typescript.

All components that are provided by the library are included in this storybook, for testing purposes and for
demonstrating each of the components as they would appear in a real world application.

Browse all component stories by navigating to them in the sidebar.

You can view their code in the `components` directory of the project to learn how they work.

We strive to follow a [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process, starting with the smallest components and working our way up.
